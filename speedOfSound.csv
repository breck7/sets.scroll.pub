Air,"The most common medium for sound, with speed influenced by temperature, humidity, and pressure",343
Water,"A denser medium than air, allowing sound to travel faster",1482
Steel,"A dense and elastic solid, sound travels much faster compared to air and water",5960
Glass,A brittle solid with a high speed of sound due to its rigidity,5200
Wood (Oak),A natural solid with varying speed depending on density and elasticity,3850
Aluminum,"A lightweight and strong metal, widely used in engineering",6320
Rubber,A flexible solid with much slower speed of sound compared to metals,1500
Concrete,"A composite material used in construction, with speed influenced by its density and composition",3200
Copper,"A highly conductive metal, also known for its high speed of sound",3900
