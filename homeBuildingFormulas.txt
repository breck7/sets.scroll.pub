Concepts
========

id,description,formula,units
Stress in Beam,Determines the internal forces within a beam,stress = moment*distanceFromNeutralAxis/secondMomentOfArea,NewtonPerSquareMeter
Shear Force in Beam,Measures the force that causes parts of a material to slide past each other in opposite directions,shearForce = ∫(dMoment/dx) dx,Newton
Bending Moment in Beam,"Calculates the reaction induced in a structural element when an external force is applied, causing the element to bend",bendingMoment = ∫(shearForce dx),NewtonMeter
Deflection of Beam,Calculates the displacement of a point on the beam under load,deflection = load*length^3 / (48*modulusOfElasticity*secondMomentOfArea),Meter
Load-Bearing Capacity,Determines the maximum weight the structure can hold,loadBearingCapacity = allowableStress * area,Newton
Thermal Conductivity,Measures the rate at which heat passes through a material,heatTransfer = thermalConductivity * area * temperatureDifference / thickness,WattPerMeterKelvin
R-Value,Indicates the resistance of a material to heat flow,rValue = thickness / thermalConductivity,SquareMeterKelvinPerWatt
Heat Loss,Calculates the total heat loss through a structure,heatLoss = area * uValue * temperatureDifference,Watt
Concrete Mix Design,Determines the proportions of materials in concrete,concreteMix = (cement : sand : aggregate : water),Ratio
Roof Slope,Determines the pitch of the roof,roofSlope = rise / run,Ratio
Brick Calculation,Estimates the number of bricks needed for a wall,numberOfBricks = wallArea / brickArea,Integer
