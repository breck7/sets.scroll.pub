Concepts
========

id,description,formula,shortFormula,units
Stress in Beam,Determines the internal forces within a beam,stress = moment*distanceFromNeutralAxis/secondMomentOfArea,σ = M*c/I,NewtonPerSquareMeter
Shear Force in Beam,Measures the force that causes parts of a material to slide past each other in opposite directions,shearForce = ∫(dMoment/dx) dx,V = ∫(dM/dx) dx,Newton
Bending Moment in Beam,"Calculates the reaction induced in a structural element when an external force is applied, causing the element to bend",bendingMoment = ∫(shearForce dx),M = ∫(V dx),NewtonMeter
Deflection of Beam,Calculates the displacement of a point on the beam under load,deflection = load*length^3 / (48*modulusOfElasticity*secondMomentOfArea),δ = PL^3 / (48EI),Meter
Natural Frequency of Bridge,Determines the frequency at which the bridge will naturally vibrate,naturalFrequency = (1/2π) * √(stiffness/mass),f_n = (1/2π) * √(k/m),Hertz
Buckling Load,Determines the critical load at which a column will buckle,criticalLoad = π^2*modulusOfElasticity*secondMomentOfArea / (effectiveLengthFactor*length)^2,P_cr = π^2*EI / (KL)^2,Newton
Tensile Strength,Measures the resistance of a material to breaking under tension,tensileStrength = load/area,σ_t = P/A,NewtonPerSquareMeter
Load-Bearing Capacity,Determines the maximum weight the bridge can hold,loadBearingCapacity = allowableStress * area,P = f * A,Newton
